**Purpose**: The following text (e-mail) aims at providing guidance to speakers in HPC Best Practices webinar series. 
Suggested subject: preparations for date webinar 

Dear speaker,

As a preparation for your webinar in the HPC Best Practices series on date, we have set a doodle poll for a dry-run, URL to doodle poll. (You should have received an email from doodle already.) Once we decide on a date for the dry-run, we will send you an invitation for a video conference event.

The purpose of the dry-run is twofold:

- You become familiarized with the video conferencing service that will be used for the webinar (usually WebEx).
- You get feedback from members of the IDEAS ECP Project, for a potential fine-tuning of your presentation. 

We recommend the following:

- The material for the dry-run should already be close to the material for the webinar. 
- You should consider a broad audience, and include pointers for both basic information (maybe at the beginning) and supplementary/advanced information (maybe at the end).
- You should target no more than 40 minutes of content.  This allows ample time for Q&A, and participants would not complain about a shorter session. 
- Please ensure that all slides are numbered, as it helps with the Q&A. 
- Build in brief breaks to ask if there are questions. We will receive questions through a google doc and the chat of the video conferencing service and relay those questions to you.

As a reminder, the final version of your slides are due on date - 2 days, so we can send them to all registered participants on da
