Dear [speaker(s) name(s)],

We would like to start the preparations for your webinar in the HPC Best Practices series, https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars, on [webinar date].

To begin, please send us a title + abstract + bio by [date of previous webinar - one week], so we can start announcing your webinar a month in advance.

A major item for the preparations consists of a dry-run, whose purpose is twofold:

-- You become familiarized with the video conferencing service that will be used for the webinar (usually WebEx).
-- You receive feedback from members of the IDEAS ECP Project, for a potential fine-tuning of your presentation.

We have set a doodle poll for the dry-run, [URL to doodle poll], and you will receive an email from doodle as well. Once we decide on a date for the dry-run, we will set a video conference event and send you an invitation.

We recommend the following:

-- The outline of your presentation and the material for the dry-run should already be close to the material for the webinar.
-- Target no more than 40 minutes of content. This allows ample time for Q&A and participants would not complain about a shorter session. (If you think that you have a lot of material to cover, we could consider braking it multiple presentations.)
-- Number the slides, as it helps with the Q&A.
-- Build in brief breaks to ask if there are questions from the audience. We will receive questions through a google doc and the chat in the video conferencing service, and relay those questions to you at the breaks.
-- Consider a broad audience, and include pointers for both basic information (maybe at the beginning of the presentation) and supplementary/advanced information (maybe at the end of the presentation).

If you have not participated in one of the webinars in the HPC Best Practices, we encourage you to do so, to help you get a feeling about how things work. The next webinar will be on [preceding webinar date], [URL to preceding webinar], at the end of which we will announce your webinar and open registrations.

The final version of your slides are due on ([webinar date] - 2 days), so we can send them to all registered participants on ([webinar date] - 1 day).

Thank you for contributing to the HPC Best Practices Webinar series.
