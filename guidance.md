Dear [speaker(s) name(s)],

We would like to start the preparations for your webinar in the HPC Best Practices series (HPC-BP), 
https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars, on [webinar date and time]. Please send us 
a title + abstract + bio by [date], so we can start announcing your webinar well in advance (e.g. by listing 
the webinar in https://www.exascaleproject.org, etc.)

An important item in our checklist consists of a dry-run, whose purpose is twofold:

* You become familiarized with the video conferencing service that will be used for the webinar (usually WebEx).
* You receive feedback from members of the IDEAS-ECP Project, for a potential fine-tuning of your presentation.

We will set a Doodle poll for scheduling the dry-run (expect to receive an e-mail from Doodle). Our goal is to 
schedule the dry-run at least a week before the webinar. Once we decide on a date for the dry-run, we will set 
a video conference event and send you an invitation.

We recommend the following:

* The outline of your presentation and the material for the dry-run should already be close to the material for the 
webinar.
* Target no more than 40 minutes of content. This allows ample time for Q&A and participants would not complain about 
a shorter session. (If you think that you have a lot of material to cover, we could consider breaking it in multiple
presentations.)
* Number the slides, as it helps with the Q&A.
* Build in brief breaks to ask if there are questions from the audience. We will receive questions through a Google 
doc and the chat in the video conferencing service, and relay those questions to you at the breaks.
* Consider a broad audience, and include pointers for both basic information (maybe at the beginning of the 
presentation) and supplementary/advanced information (maybe at the end of the presentation).

If you have not participated in one of the webinars in the HPC-BP series, we encourage you to do so, to help you 
get a feeling about how things work. The next webinar will be on [webinar date], [link to webinar], at the end 
of which we will refer to your webinar.

The final version of your slides are due on [webinar date - 2 days], so we can send them to all registered 
participants on [webinar date - 1 day].

Thank you for contributing to the HPC-BP Webinar series.
