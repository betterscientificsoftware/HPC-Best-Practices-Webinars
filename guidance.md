Dear speaker(s),

In preparation for your webinar in the HPC Best Practices series on [month day], please send us a title + abstract + 
bio. When?

As part of the preparations, we have set a doodle poll for a dry-run, [URL to doodle poll], and wou should have received 
an email from doodle already. Once we decide on a date, we will send you an invitation for a video conference event 
for the dry-run.

The purpose of the dry-run is twofold:

- You become familiarized with the video conferencing service that will be used for the webinar (usually WebEx).
- You get feedback from members of the IDEAS ECP Project, for fine-tuning of your presentation. 

We recommend the following:

- The material for the dry-run should already be close to the material for the webinar. 
- You should consider a broad audience, and include pointers for both basic information (maybe at the beginning) and supplementary/advanced information (maybe at the end).
- You should target no more than 40 minutes of content. This allows ample time for Q&A, and participants would not complain about a shorter session. 
- Please ensure that all slides are numbered, as it helps with the Q&A. 
- Build in brief breaks to ask if there are questions. We will receive questions through a google doc and the chat of the video conferencing service and relay those questions to you.

The final version of your slides are due on ([month day] - 2 days) [day of the week], so we can send them (in pdf format) to all registered participants on ([month day] - 1 day) [day of the week].

With best regards,

X
