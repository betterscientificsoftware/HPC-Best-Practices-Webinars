# HPC Best Practice Webinars

The [HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) Webinars Series](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars) 
disseminates software development methodologies, tools and experiences to improve developer productivity and software 
sustainability. HPC-BP is an outreach component of the [IDEAS Productivity Project](https://ideas-productivity.org) 
and has been designed to support the IDEAS mission to work with scientific software development teams to enhance 
their productivity and the sustainability of their codes. This repository contains information and documents 
related to the series' process.
