# HPC Best Practice Webinars

The [HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) Webinars Series](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars) 
disseminates software development methodologies, tools and experiences to improve developer productivity and software 
sustainability. HPC-BP is an outreach component of the [IDEAS Productivity Project](https://ideas-productivity.org) 
and has been designed to support the IDEAS mission to work with scientific software development teams to enhance 
their productivity and the sustainability of their codes. Currently, we refer to the project as IDEAS-ECP, as it 
focuses on the efforts sponsored by DOE's [Exascale Computing Project (ECP)](https://www.exascaleproject.org).

This repository contains information and documents related to the process for delivering webinars in the HPC-BP series.
We provide a generic checklist that can be adapted to other types of organizations, and indicate what is specific to HPC-BP.

#### Chronology

The webinars in the HPC-BP series occur approximately once a month and last about one hour each. 
IDEAS-ECP maintains a pool of potential topics, and project members deliberate on topics that are considered timely.
Each webinar in the series is implemented in concert with a checklist. The important events are the following:

1. webinar date minus ~60 days: presenter receives guidance about the process that will be followed for delivering the webinar
1. webinar date minus ~40 days: webinar is announced
1. webinar date minus ~14 days: presenter participates in a dry-run
1. webinar date minus   2 days: presenter provides the final version of the presentation material
