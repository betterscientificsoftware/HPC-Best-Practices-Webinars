# HPC Best Practice Webinars

This is work in progress.

#### Goals

The [HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) Webinars Series](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars) 
disseminates software development methodologies, tools and experiences to improve developer productivity and software 
sustainability. HPC-BP is an outreach component of the [IDEAS Productivity Project](https://ideas-productivity.org) 
and has been designed to support the IDEAS mission to work with scientific software development teams to enhance 
their productivity and the sustainability of their codes. This repository contains a collection of documents 
related to HPC-BP process.

For each HPC-BP webinar, the important items in the checklist are:

1. webinar date minus ~60 days: title + abstract + speaker bio
1. webinar date minus ~14 days: dry-run
1. webinar date minus   2 days: final version of slides

Checklist item 1 is accompanied by an [e-mail that provides guidance](guidance.md) to the webinar presenter(s).
