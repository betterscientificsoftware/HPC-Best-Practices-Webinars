# How To Produce a Webinar Series

The [HPC Best Practices (HPC-BP) Webinars Series](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars) 
disseminates software development methodologies, tools and experiences to improve developer productivity and software 
sustainability. HPC-BP is an outreach component of the [IDEAS Productivity Project](https://ideas-productivity.org) 
and has been designed to support the IDEAS mission to work with scientific software development teams to enhance 
their productivity and the sustainability of their codes. Currently, we refer to the project as IDEAS-ECP, as it 
focuses primarily on the activities sponsored by DOE's [Exascale Computing Project (ECP)](https://www.exascaleproject.org). 
The IDEAS Productivity Project [archives the contents](https://ideas-productivity.org/events/hpc-best-practices-webinars) 
of all webinars.

This repository contains information and documents related to a process for delivering webinars. Our goal is to provide 
general guidance. We provide a generic checklist that can be adapted to different types of organizations, and use
indicate HPC-BP specifics as an example.

#### Timeline

The webinars in the HPC-BP series occur approximately once a month and last about one hour each. 
IDEAS-ECP maintains a pool of potential topics, suggested by members of the project and the HPC community,
and project members deliberate on topic timeliness. Each webinar in the series is implemented in concert with a 
checklist. The important dates are the following:

| countdown | action |
| --- | --- |
| webinar date minus ~60 days | presenter receives guidance about the process for delivering the webinar |
| webinar date minus ~40 days | webinar is announced through a variety of channels |
| webinar date minus ~14 days | presenter participates in a dry-run |
| webinar date minus   2 days | presenter provides the final version of the presentation material |
